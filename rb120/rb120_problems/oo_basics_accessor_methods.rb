# 1. Reading and Writing
# Add the appropriate accessor methods to the following code.

# class Person
#   attr_accessor :name
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.name = 'Jessica'
# puts person1.name

# 2. Choose the Right Method
# Add the appropriate accessor methods to the following code.


# class Person
#   attr_accessor :name
#   attr_writer :phone_number
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.name = 'Jessica'
# person1.phone_number = '0123456789'
# puts person1.name

# 3. Access Denied
# Modify the following code so that the value of @phone_number can still be read as on line 10, 
# but cannot be changed as on line 12.
# class Person
#   attr_reader :phone_number

#   def initialize(number)
#     @phone_number = number
#   end
# end

# person1 = Person.new(1234567899)
# puts person1.phone_number

# person1.phone_number = 9987654321
# puts person1.phone_number

# 4. Comparing Names
# Using the following code, add the appropriate accessor methods. Keep in mind that the last_name getter 
# shouldn't be visible outside the class, while the first_name getter should be visible outside the class.

# class Person
#   attr_writer :last_name
#   attr_accessor :first_name

#   def first_equals_last?
#     first_name == last_name
#   end

#   private
#   attr_reader :last_name
# end

# class Person
#   attr_accessor :first_name
#   attr_writer :last_name

#   def first_equals_last?
#     first_name == @last_name
#   end
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.first_name = 'Dave'
# person1.last_name = 'Smith'
# puts person1.first_equals_last?

# 5. Who is Older?
# Using the following code, add the appropriate accessor methods. Keep in mind that @age should only
# be visible to instances of Person.

# class Person
#   attr_writer :age
  
#   def older_than?(other)
#     age > other.age
#   end

#   protected
#   attr_reader :age
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.age = 17

# person2 = Person.new
# person2.age = 26

# puts person1.older_than?(person2)

# 6. Guaranteed Formatting
# Using the following code, add the appropriate accessor methods so that @name is capitalized upon assignment.

# class Person
#   attr_reader :name
#   def name=(name)
#     @name = name.capitalize
#   end
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.name = 'eLiZaBeTh'
# puts person1.name

# 7. Prefix the Name
# Using the following code, add the appropriate accessor methods so that @name is returned with the added prefix 'Mr.'.
# class Person
#   attr_writer :name
#   def name
#     "Mr. " + @name
#   end
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.name = 'James'
# puts person1.name

# 8. Avoid Mutation
# The following code is flawed. It currently allows @name to be modified from outside the method via a destructive method call.
# Fix the code so that it returns a copy of @name instead of a reference to it.
# class Person
#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end

#   def name
#     @name.dup
#   end
# end

# person1 = Person.new('James')
# puts person1.name.reverse!
# puts person1.name

# 9. Calculated Age
# Using the following code, multiply @age by 2 upon assignment, then multiply @age by 2 again when @age
# is returned by the getter method.
# class Person
#   def age=(age)
#     @age = age * 2
#   end

#   def age
#     @age * 2
#   end
# end

# person1 = Person.new
# person1.age = 20
# puts person1.age

# 10. Unexpected Change
# Modify the following code to accept a string containing a first and last name. The name should be split into
# two instance variables in the setter method, then joined in the getter method to form a full name.
class Person
  def name=(name)
    @first_name, @last_name = name.split
  end

  def name
    "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
  end
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.name = 'John Doe'
puts person1.name
