## The PEDAC Process

## P: Understand the problem
- Establish the rules / define the boundaries of the problem
- Assess available information
  - Identify inputs and outputs 
  - Restate explicit requirements
  - Identify implicit requirements
- Spend enough time. Don't rush this step

## E: Examples and test cases
- Confirm / refute assumptions
- Help answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries

## D: Data structures
- Help reason with data logically
- Help interact with data at implementation level
- Thinking in terms of data structure is part of the problem solving process
- Data structures closely linked to algorithm
  - Set of steps form input to output
    - Involves structuring data in a certain way

## A: Algorithms
- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - CLosely linked to data structures
  - Series of steps to structure data to produce the required output
- Stay abstract / high-level
  - Avoid implementation detail
  - Don't worry about efficiency for now

## C: Implementing a solution in code
- Translating solution algorithm to code
- Think about algorithm in context of programming language
  - Language features and constraints
  - Characteristics of data structures
  - Built in functions / methods
  - Syntax and coding patterns
- Create test cases 
- Code with intent

## Final Thoughts
- Not a completely linear process
- Move back and forward between steps
- Switch from implementation mode to abstract problem solving mode when neccesary
- Don't try to problem solve at the code level
