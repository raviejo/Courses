# 10. TF-IDF
# A friend of yours wants to build a basic search engine and starts reading up on information extraction. 
# He decides to try a simple implementation of TF-IDF, a measure of the information content a term holds
# for a particular document in a document collection. However, he just started learning to code and
# somehow his numbers do not match what is expected. He knows you're enrolled in an awesome developer
# school, so he asks you to have a look.
# Term frequency - inverse document frequency:
# A measure of how important a term is to a document in a collection of documents
# (the importance increases proportionally to the term frequency in the document,
# but decreases with the frequency of the word across documents)

  tf(term, document) * idf(term, documents)

# Term frequency (simple version):
# the number of times a term occurs in a document

def tf(term, document)
  document.split(/[\s-]/).count { |word| word.downcase == term }

# Inverse document frequency:
# measure of how much information the word provides,
# based on the number of documents in which it occurs
# (the rarer it is, the more information it provides)

document1 = "Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment often featured in discussions of the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger devised " +
"it in 1935 as an argument against the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which states that an object in a physical system can simultaneously exist in all possible configurations, " +
"a state called quantum superposition, and only observing the system forces the object into just one of those possible states. Schrödinger disagreed with this interpretation. In particular, " +
"quantum superposition could not work with larger objects. As an illustration, he presented a scenario with a cat in a sealed box, whose fate was linked to a subatomic event that may or may not occur. " +
"In a quantum superposed state of the subatomic particles, the cat would be both alive and dead, until someone opened the box and observed it."

document2 = "The domestic cat is a small, furry, carnivorous mammal. The term cat can, however, also refer to wild cats, which include animals like lions, tigers and leopards. " +
"Cats are claimed to have a lower social IQ than dogs but can solve more difficult cognitive problems and have a longer-term memory. International Cat Day is celebrated on August 8. " +

"but a continual learning journey of micro-improvements. At Launch School, we're not trying to catch a wave or take advantage of a surge in demand. Instead, we're trying to focus on things that'll be useful to you for decades to come, " +
"such as a systematic problem-solving approach or learning how to deconstruct a programming language or building sound mental representations of how web application work. Everything we're trying to do at " +
"Launch School is with an eye towards sustainable studying habits and building skills for a long-term career."
